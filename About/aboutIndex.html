            <h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
  I love television and films and I try to find some sort of inspiration in the films I watch.
  I used to call, what I considered, profound and meaningful moments in my life <i>Movie Moments</i> and I use these thoughts in my art.
  Movies are like adventures where anything and everything is possible.
  So when I think artistically and creatively, I see everything in new and interesting ways.
  </p>
<p>
 From zany cartoons to intense action or horror sequences, I see something creative and surreal that I can create.
  For example, I can image monkeys jumping up and down on a teacher's desk  or cupcake monsters taking over my notebooks.
   I use these thoughts as inspiration.  I see something creative or humorous in almost everything.
 I used my imagination to create funny stories.
  Just picturing what could be created and how funny things would look like when I image my art.
  This is when art is most interesting to me.

</p>
<p>
  I love to play with technology, draw, animate, and adventure.
   I plan to further my knowladge through programs and other utilities so that I can become an expert in what I do.
  I want to become an expert in cyber security because I have a quick learning and adaptability skill when coding and developing.
   I hope I can be the best at what I do and really make a difference.
